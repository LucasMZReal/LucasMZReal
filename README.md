Have contributed translations for PT-BR notably for:

  * [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org) and its components (maintaining)
  * [microG](https://microg.org) (maintaining)
  * Other miscellaneaous projects, mostly relating to Android FOSS apps, OSes, or projects in general.

If my work benefited you in someway, and you'd like to donate some amount, you can contact me using Signal or Matrix, or using the Monero address in my Mastodon account.
You can also help by also contributing to the projects I support, such as CalyxOS and microG. These are services I use and that need help with any contributions they can get.

Have donated to:
  * [Calyx Institute](https://calyxinstitute.org (~R$ 150)
  * [Signal](https://signal.org) (~R$ 50)
